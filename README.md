# Javascript Learning - Hands-on Practice

- Completed hands-on practice on Variables, Datatypes, Control Flow, Looping, and Functions in JavaScript.  
- Understood the use of var, let, const, different data types, input and object handling.  
- Practiced if-else, switch, and various loops (for, for-in, for-of, while, do-while).  
- Learnt and worked on functions, nested functions, recursion, declaration and definition, scope, hoisting, closures, and error handling with practical examples.  
- Gained a clear understanding of lexical scoping, IIFE, and function expressions.  
-Practiced arrays and their manipulations using methods like map(), reduce(), filter(), slice(), and splice().
-Explored object creation, inheritance, and manipulation using constructors, Object.create(), and functions.
-Understood the behavior of iterators ,  this keyword, object references, and the difference between == and ===.
-Implemented various function concepts — recursion, closures, rest parameters, and the arguments object.
-Gained understanding of how functions, objects, and arrays interact and reference each other in JavaScript.
